#!/bin/bash

# This script runs the array job spawned using the main.sh script on a
# single node on a partition to process entries with a given keyword
# in their name and are located inside a work directory. The keyword
# is provided as a command line argument in main.sh.

# This script uses OFFSET, provided as a command line argument, to
# operate on the corresponding line number in joblist.txt that stores
# all the entries matching the $KEYWORD criterion.

# Usage:
